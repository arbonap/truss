# Truss ðŸš€

Welcome to TrussParser! This is a gem that parses and normalizes CSV data according to the specs in `challenge.md`


## Installation

Assuming you have an environment set up for the Ruby ecosystem:

    $ gem install truss

## Usage

- After `gem install`ing the `truss` gem:
  - Run `truss sample.csv` to parse and normalize the `sample.csv` that is shipped along in this gem. Alternatively, you can also run `truss sample-with-broken-utf8.csv` as well. The Truss takes in a CSV file as an argument, and outputs normalized CSV data in `normalized_data.csv`.

## Testing

- Run `rake spec` to run the RSpec tests.
- You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
